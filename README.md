# SAP Build CodeJam Pre-requisites:

## Objective
Automate the steps involved in the pre-requisites for [ SAP Build CodeJam ](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/codejam-0-prerequisites.html)

## Overview
This repository contains scripts to automate BTP subaccount setup using Terraform. Please follow the instructions below for initial setup and execution.

---

## Pre-requisites

Before starting the deployment process, ensure the following:
- **Node.js (v18 or higher)** and **npm** are installed.
- **CDK for Terraform CLI (`cdktf`)** is installed globally.
- You are an **administrator** of the SAP BTP **Global Account**.
- The Global Account has the **required entitlements** assigned (e.g., relevant service plans used in the Terraform scripts).
- The Global Account has sufficient **resource quotas** (e.g., application runtime, service instances).

Note: By default, these permissions, entitlements, quotas should already be available if this is a fresh BTP Trial account(i.e. Build Apps is not already subscribed in this BTP global account), so no additional setup is necessary.
